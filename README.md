## Golfy-Golfy-

A fun 2d mini golf game using the pygame moudle in python visual studio code(VS code).

## Game idea

 You control a ball and play mini golf.
 
 ## Game Controls
 
 Tap the screen to the opposite side of where you want to shoot. The longer you hold, the further the ball shoots.

## Bugs

The sound effects might not work sometimes and it can be hard to shoot the ball.

## Note

NOTE: There isn`t an EXE file for the game just yet, so you have to open the code and run it manually.
